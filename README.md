+ Project summary: In this project, we compared two clustering algorithms naive bayes, in paper2, and error driven online training combining with hierirchical clustering. There are two main RMarkdown files, on for each paper. Each pdf contains the procedure and evaluation for that algorithm. The overall main file "main.rmd" contains the comparison for two algorithms.

Imorze try to code both paper in Python and creating PPT for presentaion. Nikita did NOT contribute to this project at all.
