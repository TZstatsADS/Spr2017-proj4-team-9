+ Project summary: In this project, we compared two clustering algorithms naive bayes, in paper2, and error driven online training with ranked loss function implemented as heiracharcal clustering. There are two main RMarkdown files, on for each paper in addition to Jupyter notebooks that implemented Paper 5 in a different way as well as with an original dataset from the paper. Each pdf contains the procedure and evaluation for that algorithm. The overall main file "main.rmd" contains the comparison for two algorithms.   
	
**Contribution statement**:Xuehan completed the coding for paper 5 in R and is presenting the project. Imroze picked the evaluation measures for paper 5 in the implementation available in the RMarkdown, completed the jupyter notebooks availabe in the repository and did the skeleton of the powerpoint presentation (with members contributing their R code and results). There are two jupyter notebooks, and one python file. There you can see a model implemented with an original dataset from the paper in addition to the assigned dataset. Hongyi completed major parts of coding for paper2, while Mengcheng helped with the debugging process for the code.Nikita did NOT contribute to this project at all.
